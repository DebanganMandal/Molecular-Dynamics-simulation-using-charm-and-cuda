# Molecular-Dynamics-simulation-using-charm-and-cuda
In this repository, contains the implementation of how parallel computing can help in reducing the calculations of various interaction between atomic or molecular particles upon knowing a limitied amount of knowledge.
This will help in further research in bio mdeical sciences or neurology and such develpoments are something to work upon.
